# Enhanced-Drowsiness-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Driver's drowsiness is monitored through the deep learning model called CNN - Convolutional Neural Network
This project aims to develop an efficient model to monitor the driver's drowsiness and alert according to their change facial features

# Abstract

	Road safety is a significant public health issue, and a cause of injuries and fatalities. According to a report by the Ministry of 
Road Transport and Highways Transport Research Wing, road accidents claimed 1,53,972 lives and harmed 3,84,448 people in 2021. Unfortunately, 
the age range that is most severely hit by road accidents is 18 to 45 years old, which accounts for almost 67 percent of all accidental deaths.
	A crucial problem that causes numerous car accidents annually is driver fatigue. Due to the incapacity of a driver to halt or swerve to
prevent or minimise the impact, accidents caused by driver sleepiness are much more inclined to result in fatalities or severe accidents. Fatigue 
lowers attentiveness, alertness, and concentration, which impairs the accomplishment of tasks requiring attention such as driving.
