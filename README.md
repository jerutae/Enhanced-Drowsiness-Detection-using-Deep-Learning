# Enhanced-Drowsiness-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Driver's drowsiness is monitored through the deep learning model called CNN - Convolutional Neural Network
This project aims to develop an efficient model to monitor the driver's drowsiness and alert according to their change facial features

# Abstract

  Road safety is a significant public health issue, and a cause of injuries and fatalities. According to a report by the 
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways Transport Research Wing, road accidents claimed 1,53,972 lives and harmed 3,84,448 people 
in 2021. Unfortunately, the age range that is most severely hit by road accidents is 18 to 45 years old, which accounts for almost
67 percent of all accidental deaths.
	A crucial problem that causes numerous car accidents annually is driver fatigue. Due to the incapacity of a driver to halt or swerve to
prevent or minimise the impact, accidents caused by driver sleepiness are much more inclined to result in fatalities or severe accidents. Fatigue 
lowers attentiveness, alertness, and concentration, which impairs the accomplishment of tasks requiring attention such as driving.

# Working of CNN
In this project, in order to reduce the accidents that are caused by driver’s drowsiness or sleepiness, a driver drowsiness detection system is developed with the help of deep learning techniques. Initially Dataset contains images of both the closed and open eyes of several persons were collected to train the model. Before the training of model takes place, the images are preprocessed so that the dataset can be directly applied to the deep learning algorithm for further process. After preprocessing, our model has been trained. A convolutional neural network (CNN or convnet) is a subset of machine learning. It is one of the various types of artificial neural networks which are used for different applications and data types. A CNN is a kind of network architecture for deep learning algorithms and is specifically used for image recognition and tasks that involve the processing of pixel data. Our system will be installed in automobiles such as cars, buses etc. Our system continuously monitors the eyes of the driver. Whenever the user feels drowsy (He / She feels sleepy by closing the eyes), our system alerts the driver with a beep sound as its primary response. The Alarm goes on increasing when the driver doesn’t wakeup. Then our system is making a phone call to the driver’s emergency contact person or relatives to inform that the person feels drowsy or sleeping while driving along with the driver’s coordinates. Thus, this system effectively reduces the risk of road accidents that are caused by driver’s carelessness.
